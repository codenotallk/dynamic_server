# Dynamic Server

This server is a small project to load endpoints dynamically.


First I'll create the interface to allow the create plugins, which are in that case 
endpoints.

Now I'll create the server.

I think server is ready to run

Server's running. I'll create the plugin

Now I can load endpoints to my server. That's it.
